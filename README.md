# Instagram-user-analysis
1.Project Description
The aim of this project is to analyse Instagram user interactions and engagement data using SQL. User analysis involves tracking how users engage with a digital product, such as software application or a mobile app. By deriving specific questions posed by the management team, the analysis provides insights into user behaviour, platform trends, and engagement patterns. The findings will support informed decision-making for marketing campaigns, product improvement and investor reports.

4. Likes: Stores the information about the photos liked by users like user_id, photo_id, created_at.
5. Follows: This table tracks follower relationships between users who follow each other on platform like follower_id, followee_id, created_at.
6. Tags: Stores information about tags like id, tag_name, created_at.
7. Photo tags: This table tracks relationship between photos and tags and stores information like photo_id, tag_id.
